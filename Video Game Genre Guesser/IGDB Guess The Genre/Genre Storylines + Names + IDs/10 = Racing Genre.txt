    "storyline": "The gameplay system remains unchanged from Ridge Racer (with the exception of the addition of a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view, inherited from the 1994 arcade sequel Ridge Racer 2) with its set of checkpoints, time-limit, and the same cars. The player can drive using either automatic transmission or manual transmission. Namco\u0027s NeGcon controller can be used to play the game. The game consists of three courses: \"Novice,\" \"Intermediate\" and \"Expert\", with each one having different sections of the track opened. The game incorporates modes from the original game; normal race against eleven other cars, and Time Trial against one car. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a new race mode; Free Run. This mode is not actually a race, as there are no other cars. Rather, the player can test drive the car and practise driving around the track. There is no lap limit. A new feature of the game is the ability to select the time of day the in which the race takes place. This option is not available at the start of the game, and must be unlocked. Ridge Racer Revolution has a two-player link-up mode which also allows the players access to the two courses from the original Ridge Racer game known as \u0027Special 1\u0027 and \u0027Special 2\u0027.\nLike the first Ridge Racer, the player normally starts with four cars. The remaining eight are selectable upon winning the mini game before the title screen (the mini game is Galaga \u002788 instead of the original game\u0027s Galaxian). Also like the first game, after the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions of the tracks are unlocked, and the time trial mode becomes a boss race against two other cars including the duel car. There are three duel cars; the original \"13th Racing\" devil car from the first Ridge Racer of the Novice course, and the new \"13th Racing Kid\" (of the Intermediate course) and \"White Angel\" (of the Expert course) cars. Players will obtain those cars upon winning the respective course\u0027s time trial boss race.\nThere are also two hidden modes; \"Drift Contest\", where the player earns points according to how well spins are performed on certain corners, and \"Pretty Racer\" (also known as buggy mode), which was the inspiration for the arcade game Pocket Racer. Mirrored tracks that function the same way as the original game are also accessible. As with the first game, the player can insert a music CD during the game to listen to instead of the game\u0027s soundtrack. However, unlike the first game, only the last track played is loaded into the PlayStation\u0027s memory; to switch courses the player would need to reinsert the game disc before loading the data."

The breaking up of areas means stage transitions no longer exist, and the road is always the same colour. The physics of the mascot are also simplified, always swinging and rotating at the same rate regardless of what is happening in-game. \n \nThere are also no exploding police officers when the player finishes first."

    "storyline": "R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 is an arcade-style racing game with a strong emphasis on powersliding around corners. Vehicles use one of two styles of powersliding depending on the make of car they select: Drift and Grip. Drift cars require players to tap the brake once while turning to break into a smooth powerslide while Grip cars requires players to alternate between brakes and gas while turning to powerslide.\nVehicles are earned by playing through the game\u0027s Grand Prix mode. Players select one of four teams; R.C Micro Mouse Mappy, Pac Racing Club, Racing Team Solvalou and Dig Racing Team, who each have varying difficulties, and one of four manufacturers; Age Solo, Lizard, Assoluto and Terrazi, which determines the style of car and powerslide type the player will use. In each race, the player must attempt to reach a qualifying position, with later stages requiring players to place in higher positions to qualify. Depending on the qualifying position in each race, players will be awarded a new vehicle, or an upgrade to their current one, based on their team and manufacturer, with better cars earned for reaching consistently higher positions (i.e. the best cars are earned by placing 1st in each match while the least impressive cars are earned by just clearing the minimum qualifying positions). There are a total of 320 vehicles earned by racing with every combination of team, manufacturer and qualifying position. If the players unlock all 320 cars, they will unlock an additional one modelled after Pac-Man, for a total of 321 vehicles.\nThe game also features Time Attack mode, in which players can attempt to get the fastest time on each course, and VS. Battle, a split-screen mode for two players (the first to appear in the home console series) and an undocumented PlayStation Link Cable mode, allowing four players to play simultaneously. Players can also create them our car decors and participate in Extra Trials against powerful prototype cars. The game is also compatible with the JogCon peripheral and the PocketStation device, which allows players to trade cars with friends.\nA further new feature was the Decal Edit, which allowed players to design their own logo for use on cars."

The twelve cars are varied in their specifications, with some featuring a high top speed, others excelling at acceleration or turning, and others being more balanced. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. Once the game has loaded, all the CD is needed for afterwards is to play six instrumental music tracks. The player can replace the disc at any time during gameplay, although the game does not update to reflect the switch; regardless of what disc is inserted, there will always be six tracks to choose from, corresponding the starting points of the six tracks on the game disc.\nAfter launching the game, the player can choose a course, transmission (automatic or six-speed manual), car and song. During the race, the player can observe the racetrack from the first-person perspective (or from the third-person perspective for the PlayStation version). Namco\u0027s NeGcon controller can be used to play the game. Being an arcade racer, collisions do no damage to the car, and merely slow the player down. There is also a time limit, which ends the game if it counts down to zero. Checkpoints are present throughout the track that give the player additional time when passed through.\nThe game features only a single race track, although it consists of four race configurations of varying difficulty; Novice, Intermediate, Advanced and Time Trial (in the latter two, the track is extended). The player races against eleven other cars except in Time Trial, where there is only one opponent. The higher the difficulty level, the faster the cars run, with Time Trial mode featuring the fastest cars. Each race consists of three laps (two on the beginner course). In the PlayStation version, after the player wins every race, \"extra\" races become available, which are raced on a reversed version of the course, and the player encounters an additional opponent in Time Trial mode; the 13th Racing \"Devil\" car, the fastest car in the game. Upon winning this race, the car is unlocked for the player to drive. In the arcade version, after finishing the game, the winning player\u0027s score is saved in action-replay highlights.\nThe PlayStation version also features hidden \"mirror\" version of the tracks.
