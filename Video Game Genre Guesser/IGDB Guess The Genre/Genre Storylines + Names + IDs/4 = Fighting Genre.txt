The world of the living, Ushyo, and the land of the dead, Tokoyo. A legendary boundary to forever separate them, The Hell\u0027s Gate, has existed since the birth of myths to keep an universal balance. There is said to be four gods that defend it: Seiryu of the East, Byakko of the West, Genbu of the North, and Suzaku of the South. They eternally perform their duty from the shadows of legend and were eventually forgotten by people as time passed. \n \nNow, it is the \u0027Bakumatsu\u0027. \n \nThe Tokugawa shogunate, after 200 years of reign, began to have samurai who long dulled their battle skills during the outskirts of the Heian period. People, who have long since grown used to peace, are met with fascinating foreigners and wonder about the confines of their isolation. To add to the confusion, a sudden disturbance occurs. \n \nA natural disaster unprecedented in Japan\u0027s history began. It was rumored to be the Majin Revival, a time when gods were to walk the land once more and deliver divine punishment. In a land where no chaos was said to exist, the people could do nothing but watch and despair. \n \nHowever, it was said that there are individuals who did not. People who haven\u0027t lost their fighting spirit and stood to face the chaos. Those who wanted to find the real cause behind the disturbance and stop it. Moreover, people who were unexpectedly born at the center of chaos. Those who had the ambitions to control the threat and those who are said to be the cause of the Majin Revival. Without speculation of their cause, they are brought together by a heavy fate as their battle begins.\" \n \nThe passage to the land of the dead, Hell\u0027s Gate, which was previously guarded by Four Sacred Beasts appears to be opened. However, chaos sweeps the land once the gods are encased in human flesh, otherwise known as the Majin Revival. The story of the series continues to focus on how certain individuals choose to confront such conflict, and depicts how each of them are drawn on the same string of fate."

    "storyline": "The story of Rival Schools introduces the player to a Japanese city called Aoharu City, where several local schools are the victims of unknown attacks and kidnappings of students and staff. The various characters in the game set out to find who is responsible for the attacks on their school, with the cut-scenes and fights portraying their interactions with the other schools and among themselves. Eventually, the story reveals that an elite school in the city, Justice High, is responsible for the attacks. The player\u0027s team eventually faces off against Raizo Imawano, the principal of the school, and first boss of the game. If certain requirements are met during the fight against Raizo, the story would continue as the player would then head into a true final boss fight against Hyo Imawano, Raizo\u0027s nephew and the true mastermind behind the events of the game.\n\nThe structure of the single player game of Rival Schools varied depending on how characters were selected. If two characters from the same school were selected (with a few exceptions), single-player would play in a progressing story with fights predetermined beforehand and each fight preceding and ending with short 2D cut-scenes to explain the story. If two characters from different schools were chosen, the single-player mode would instead play similar to other fighting games, with the player\u0027s chosen team fighting against random teams of opponents before facing the boss. In the arcade, character selection was initially limited to selecting two characters from the same school and free selection of any character was accessed through time; the PlayStation versions, which included all characters unlocked by default, had no such restrictions."

There\u0027s no guarantee that even with this tournament, tragedy will not repeat itself.... \n \nThe third title in the King of Fighters: The NESTS Chronicles. At last, this tournament will end it all!\" \n \nThe NESTS cartel decides to host the 2001 KOF tournament so that they can use it as a method to eliminate their enemies and enter their own team into the ranks. \n \nIn the tournament finals, the Hero Team boards a special blimp that is soon revealed to be a spaceship. There they meet Original Zero, whose clone decimated the cartels\u0027 secrecy with his scheme in the previous year. He congratulates them for reaching the finals and states that they\u0027re headed for NESTS\u0027s real headquarters. He decides to entertain his passengers with a match and is backed up by his pet black lion Glugan, Ron, and Krizalid. Despite the oppressive force of his group, he is defeated moments before the ship docks at NESTS\u0027s space satellite. He stays on board the exploding ship and urges the Hero team to proceed forward. \n \nOnce inside NESTS\u0027s satellite, they face the NESTS leader, Nests. He expresses wishes for his renegade agents to return to the organization and is soon afterward killed by Igniz, who claims ownership of the cartel. Igniz also reveals that K\u0027, Kula, Krizalid, K9999 and Whip are guinea pigs/creations made for his own personal entertainment. Kula, who was separated from the rest of her team and present at the time, also heard her origin as an artificial life form.

As soon as he\u0027s about to kill K\u0027, other fighters came to intervene and help in the fight including all team leaders, Kyo and Iori. When he\u0027s defeated, he proclaims that he is fallen god and names himself a \"demon\" instead. He plunges the satellite through earth\u0027s atmosphere in an attempt to demolish his competition. \n \nThankfully, the satellite crashes into the ocean and the fighters aboard were somehow saved from the explosion, presumably thanks to Ron. K\u0027 saves Kula from drowning; in gratitude, she and her guardian, Diana, ally themselves with K\u0027 and company. K9999 and Angel are presumably still alive though their exact whereabouts are unknown. Foxy is also stabbed by them though her apparent on screen death is later revealed to be false."

At that time, two worlds, one near and one far, were born. Thus the history of life and death began. \n \nHalf a year has passed since Suzaku\u0027s madness, and the underworld is still linked by a great portal. Kagami\u0027s great sin is still heard as if ringing from the heavens. Our world has been called upon. Legends of long ago told of the sealing of the boundary between the two worlds. The Sealing Rite would be necessary to hold back the spirits of that far away world. \n \nHowever, the Sealing Rite brings together the power of the Four Gods and Sealing Maiden, for the first time properly completing the ritual. \n \nTo find the Sealing Maiden, Genbu began searching in the center of the world, from which all things begin. At the same time in the underworld, in the depths of darkness, many spirits conspired, plotting to hinder the Sealing Rite. They had but one wish, to be reborn into our world."

    "storyline": "The game takes place in the year 2225, A.D., on the remote world of Ruhelen in the Omicron Reticuli star system. This planet has been a contested territory between the Darken, Union, Mercs and the Scorp, which are the Union\u0027s greatest threat. The discovery of the mineral-rich Phygos star system nearby has upset the tenuous strategic balance of the four races, leading to speculation of an inevitable war. The player assumes the role of Sergeant Joshua Gant, a retired Union Intelligence Acency, (UIA), operative, who for ten years prior, has been experiencing horrifying nightmares from a mission that resulted in the loss of his best friend and comrade, Ron Pearl. Following one of Gant\u0027s nightmares, the sergeant is contacted by UIA director General Allance Wilkins, who reinstates Gant immediately for a mission of the utmost importance. According to Wilkins, the Scorp have been conducting top-secret biological warfare experiments upon human prisoners of war, in order to create a mutated super-soldier dubbed the \"G-Nome\". Gant is commanded to euthanize the G-Nome and destroy the Scorp facility that has been housing the experiments. For assistance, Gant is assigned a team that includes his old friend and munitions expert, Sergeant Stephen Kylie, Union\u0027s most accomplished geneticist, Doctor Victoria Thane and an undisclosed final member of the team operating within the Scorp territory. \n \nGant begins his mission by traversing the Darken Republic on foot and strategically taking out any opposition that would hinder his objective of rendezvousing with Kylie. United once again, the duo embark across the Merc territory to meet Thane, who has been on a separate assignment. Upon Wilkins\u0027 disposition, Thane identifies some specialized Merc technology stored away at a facilitated structure called the Citadel upon a mesa called Caracon as the means of neutralizing the G-Nome. After acquiring the technology, the team heads for the Scorp territory. \n \nGant and his team bypass the heavily-defended Scorp border, where he is introduced to the final member of his team: Major Jack Sheridan, a Scorp specialist and the man responsible for the loss of Pearl ten years prior. After several precarious skirmishes with the intent of acquiring Scorp vehicles for bypassing mine fields and learning of the G-Nome facility\u0027s location, Sheridan leads the team directly to the laboratory. The mission is compromised, however, when Sheridan attempts to kill Gant, captures the G-Nome and allows for Kylie to be captured by Scorp reinforcements. Soon after, however, the Scorp ally with Gant, with recognizing Sheridan and the G-Nome as a greater threat. The Scorp and UIA realize that Sheridan has a genetic recombination laboratory located within the volcanic Shalten Frontier, where not only is he backed by a sizable army, but he intends to clone the G-Nome.[6] \n \nAfter gaining reinforcements from Wilkins and a large confrontation at the secret facility, Sheridan kills Kylie immediately after Gant destroys the laboratory. While the Union finish off Sheridan\u0027s forces, Gant gives chase after Sheridan, with the G-Nome in tow. Gant disables Sheridan\u0027s powerful vehicles and kills him. Gant confronts and subdues the G-Nome and while examining a marker upon its paw, he discovers that Pearl was the G-Nome. In an act of mercy, Gant allows Pearl to survive and tells him to run away before the Union forces arrive. The G-Nome is seen heading toward the sunset in the ending credits of the game. \n \nAs Sheridan\u0027s forces are defeated, Wilkins rummages through the remains of the recombination lab and comes across a petri dish labelled \"G-NOME: PEARL\". Wilkins grabs the dish and departs. In the aftermath the Scorp declares war on the Union, in retaliation for the mission. Reports leak through of a covert Union operation intended to destroy the Scorp G-Nome facility, but are denied by both the Union and the Scorp, while Wilkins unexpectedly resigns, causing public speculation that the alleged operation ended in failure."

    "storyline": "Two years ago, Heihachi failed to capture Ogre. \n \nNot willing to give up, Heihachi ordered his researchers to collect blood samples, skin tissue, and hoof fragments left behind by Ogre (or known as True Ogre in its true manifestation) in order to conduct genetic experiments. Heihachi’s goal was to create a new life form by splicing Ogre’s genome with his own. However, the research was unsuccessful. \n \nAfter extensive experimentation, Heihachi’s bioengineers came to the conclusion that an additional gene - the Devil Gene - was necessary in order to successfully splice Ogre’s genetic code into another living organism. Heihachi learned that his own genome lacked the Devil Gene, but he knew someone who did... Jin Kazama. \n \nJin, who vanquished Ogre in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, was shot and mortally wounded by Heihachi. As his life slipped away, Jin transformed into a Devil. Upon his transformation, he struck down Heihachi and took flight. Jin’s whereabouts were unknown after the Tournament. \n \nHeihachi searched for Jin to no avail. However, Heihachi discovered a photograph during his investigation that stirred his curiosity. The 20-year-old photograph was an image of a burnt corpse covered with laceration wounds. Heihachi paid particular attention to the corpse’s back, which had what looked like deformed, protruding wing-like limbs. \n \nConvinced that the picture was of Kazuya, his own son whom he threw into a volcano 20 years ago, Heihachi diverted all his resources into a search for the body. This search eventually led Heihachi to G Corporation, a leading-edge biotech firm making unprecedented advances in the field of biogenetics research. \n \nHeihachi discovered that G Corporation found the corpse and extracted and analyzed its genetic data. In fact, Heihachi learned that the company was in the midst of creating a new life form by using the data. Heihachi also determined that Kazuya’s remains and research data were secured at G Corporation’s Nebraska and Nepal research laboratories, respectively. \n \nFriday, 25 December. The Tekken Force raided G Corporation’s maximum security research laboratory in Nepal. The bottom floors of the building were obliterated, and the remaining data storage facility containing file servers was airlifted by a group of heavy-duty helicopters. \n \nAt the same time, a separate unit led by Heihachi infiltrated the underground research facility in Nebraska, where Kazuya’s remains were preserved. As Heihachi observed from his helicopter, he soon realized that unlike the Nepal facility, the operations in Nebraska were not going according to plan. The tactical status monitor screens showed the first wave of the Tekken Force troops being blown out from the storage room where Kazuya’s remains were supposedly kept. \n \nA silhouette of a large figure slowly emerged from the room... When Heihachi could see clearly enough, he instantly recognized the large figure as Kazuya. \n \nKazuya was resurrected in G Corporation’s research facility. After his resurrection, Kazuya offered his body as research material to determine the true nature of the Devil that resided within him. Kazuya’s goal was to unify his two selves into one. Kazuya theorized that if he unified his body with the Devil, he would be able to truly harness its powers. He could then finally take revenge against Heihachi and the Mishima Zaibatsu. \n \nEnraged that Heihachi thwarted his plans, Kazuya obliterated the heavily armed Tekken Force and vanished into the flames of the lab’s wreckage. Heihachi was infuriated by Kazuya’s escape and took out his anger on his hapless subordinates who reported the escape. \n \nAbel, Heihachi’s lead scientific advisor, urged the enraged Heihachi to quickly find a way to capture Kazuya. Once his anger subsided, Heihachi focused his mind and decided on a plan. An evil smile crept upon his lips. \n \nTwo years had passed since The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3. The Mishima Zaibatsu announced The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and placed the massive financial empire as the top prize. The champion who manages to defeat Heihachi at the end of the Tournament would inherit the Mishima Zaibatsu. \n \nWell aware that the tournament is just a trap designed to lure him out, Kazuya nevertheless enters - it is his chance to defeat Heihachi. \n \nIn the round 7, Jin and Kazuya was scheduled to fight. However, on the way to fight Kazuya who waits in the stage Jin was ambushed and captured by Tekken Force before he was taken and chained in the Honmaru. Kazuya was announced as a default winner and he was sent to the final stage where he met Heihachi and asked him where Jin was. Heihachi promised he would answer after the fight; he was planning to take Kazuya to Honmaru after winning the fight and finish him off along with Jin by chaining him. He intentionally did this because he was more interested in torturing Kazuya. In the final stage 2 were clashed into battle resulting in Kazuya as a winner. After losing in the fight, Heihachi was being forced to take Kazuya to Honmaru and he was knocked out by Kazuya\u0027s devil power. Kazuya tried to suck out Jin\u0027s devil power but he failed. Eventually Jin woke up after being taunted by Kazuya and broke out of chain with rage. Kazuya fought against confronting Jin, but he was not able to defeat him and was left unconsciousness. Then Heihachi woke up and tried to kill exhausted Jin but he was defeated again and he was about to be killed if not for Jin\u0027s reminiscence of his mother, Jun Kazama, which caused him to spare Heihachi in honor of his mother. Stretching his Devil wings, Jin took a flight, leaving the unconscious Kazuya and Heihachi in Hon-Maru.."
