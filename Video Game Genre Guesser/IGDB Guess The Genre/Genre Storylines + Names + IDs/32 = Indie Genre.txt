After many failed experiments the number # 131 has presented changes happy changes that make this living being more complete to the failed experiments, his ability to breathe was effective, his lungs (if you can call it or respiratory system) were fed of Nitrogen which benefited its existence on earth. He did not need a female to reproduce he did it through the saliva but there must be another being like him and if the saliva interacted with the skin, it morbidly reproduced, this impressed Giorgo Mezzatti and he called it the successful Experiment \"Varily\". Byron and Zeti, who were indirectly involved in this experiment, knew that having this living thing was not the best idea since it had delusions of aggressiveness and hunger for raw flesh, however, they agreed to Orders at \"simple sight\". After completing a long series of experiments Byron and his friends returned home after leaving the city of Villa del Rosario (a city located south of Zulia) heading to San Ignacio, a town further south that has grown to measure of time and a lot, Byron lived in a fairly simple country house near a Forest and her friend Zeti lived more to the center of town through the square, one day she visited Byron to talk about some Test or tests they had done of the experiment Varily about their loyalty to the living beings, this worried them and they immediately called their boss but he paid little attention to them since he was happy with his experiment and his unhelpful plan, then the boss asks them on that same call - \" I thought you had experimented with 3, but I only see 2? \"- and this worried them more and answered Byron -\" If that\u0027s the way it\u0027s 3 we experienced boss with, please tell me it\u0027s a joke \"- The boss replied -\" No , Byron I only see 2 I think qu e to be in the laboratory for so long has made illusions, well I give congratulations and I have to go, Goodbye \"-. Concerned about the disappearance of that experiment, they returned to Villa del Rosario, after 2 hours of research and search of the experiment they decided to go home after not finding it, they rested and thought about the best."
