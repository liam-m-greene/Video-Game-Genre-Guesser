    "name": "The X-Files",
    "storyline": "The game takes place somewhere within the timeline of the third season of The X-Files series. The story follows a young Seattle-based FBI agent named Craig Willmore (played by Jordan Lee Williams) who is assigned by Assistant Director Walter Skinner to investigate the disappearance of agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, who were last seen in the Everett, Washington area. Agent Willmore must use his state-of-the-art spy tools: night vision goggles, a digital camera, PDA (an Apple Newton), lock picks, evidence kit, a standard issue handgun, a pair of handcuffs, and a badge to follow their trail. Along the way, he is partnered with a Seattle Police Department detective named Mary Astadourian (played by Paige Witte) and a minor subplot involves a relationship developing between the two. \n \nSeveral of the actors from the TV series reprise their roles in the game, including David Duchovny (Mulder), Gillian Anderson (Scully), Mitch Pileggi (Skinner), Steven Williams (X), Bruce Harwood, Tom Braidwood and Dean Haglund (The Lone Gunmen) and—very briefly and depending upon the outcome of the game—William B. Davis (The Smoking Man). The game is set and was filmed in Seattle. The TV series actors filmed their relatively brief appearances in the game just before entering production on the feature film. The game\u0027s plotline involves aliens taking over the bodies of humans and contains many references to the show\u0027s extraterrestrial mythology. During the course of the game the \"present day\" date of April 1996 is displayed alongside certain locations, placing this \"episode\" after the season three episode \"Avatar\" and before \"Wetwired\" , which take place March 7 and April 27 respectively. This time is also after the first incident with the alien black oil in the episode \"Piper Maru\" of the third season. \n \nThe screenplay for X-Files The Game was written by Richard Dowdy, Greg Roach and Frank Spotnitz, from a story by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz."

    "storyline": "* Requires at least 2 players to play, and both should have smartphones--or any device with a browser--that have internet \n* You can set-up a mobile hotspot with your own phone if your playmates do not have internet \nWhile in the lobby, create a Player by entering a name, then click \u0027New Game\u0027, and enter a password. Then, share that password to your playmates. They themselves also need to create a Player, and then they would click the newly created game that will pop-up on the \u0027Lobby\u0027 page, and enter the password to join the game. \n* Choose your Team in the Team Selection screen, and click \u0027Ready\u0027. If everyone has clicked \u0027Ready\u0027 already, the game will then start immediately afterwards. \n* On the \"Cards Selection\" screen, a deck of 24 random cards will be available to play, 4 of which will be drawn at the start. Turn order will be automatically assigned to each of you. You\u0027ll know if it\u0027s your turn already if you see the \"Your turn\" message at the very top, just right above the cards. If you do not see it, then it is currently someone else\u0027s turn. \nIf it\u0027s your turn, talk with your teammates, and decide wisely which of the four back-facing cards you are going to choose and have them guess. Upon clicking (selecting) a card, it will flip and reveal itself only on your screen, and won\u0027t show up to the other players. The timer countdown would then immediately start to tick. \n  - The \"Bomb\" icon means that the time-limit is 15 seconds, half of the normal 30 seconds. \n  - The \"Question\" icon means that the card can be ANY category. This card therefore is a lot harder to guess, but is why it has +2 extra stars count than its normal supposed value \n  - The \"Stars\" represent the \u0027unpopularity\u0027 of the card (as evaluated by Google Trends: 0-33 \u003d 3 stars; 34-66 \u003d 2 stars; 67-100 \u003d 1 star). Each star gives +1 point to your score. Therefore, if you managed to guess a 3-star card, then your team will get +3 points. \n* As the timer ticks, you should describe the card through adjectives, AND, and OR only. You need to be fast! reactive! and... imaginative! :) No nouns and verbs allowed! Example... \"Animal: small AND black OR white AND furry\". Guess what? a cat! :D \n* Your teammates can try to guess as much as they want within the time limit. If they didn\u0027t succeed, then the other teams each have just one chance to guess the card. Should everyone guessed incorrectly, then no points shall be given. \n* After all cards have been used up, the highest scoring team will be the winner! That\u0027s just about it! :) Enjoy!"
