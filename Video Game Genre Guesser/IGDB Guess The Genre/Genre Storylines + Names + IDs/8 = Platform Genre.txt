Reimu Hakurei sets out to the Scarlet Devil Mansion, since that was where the previous scarlet mist incident happened previously, to fix this problem. Along the way, she meets Marisa Kirisame, who joins Reimu, and Cirno, who attacks Reimu for making fun of her. Eventually, Cirno ends up joining Reimu\u0027s party due to unforeseen circumstances. \n \nOnce Reimu and her get to the Scarlet Devil\u0027s place, they find a great castle. Hong Meiling guards the gate to the castle. Reimu defeats her with relative ease. Reimu enters the castle, and runs into Sakuya Izayoi. Reimu asks where Remilia Scarlet is, and Sakuya says she is resting in her chambers. Sakuya then proceeds to \"take out the trash.\" Sakuya is defeated, but she warns that they are only reaching towards their death. As Reimu and the party move on, they meet Alice Margatroid, who is said to be there to play. Marisa doesn\u0027t believe this, as everyone knows Alice has no friends. They fight, and Alice loses. The three proceed to the arena part of the castle, and meet Suika Ibuki, who is there because she wanted to go somewhere other than the Hakurei Shrine for once. The party defeats Suika, and Suika says after this incident is solved, they should throw a party back at the shrine. \n \nIn the library, they meet Patchouli Knowledge, and defeat her. Reimu then proceeds up to the clock tower, where the moon begins to turn a scarlet color. On the top of the tower, they are intercepted by Sakuya once more. Sakuya is defeated again, but the heroines wonder what Remilia\u0027s plan is. Apparently, Sakuya does not know what Remilia is doing, and was only instructed to build the castle. Patchouli states that the last time Remilia was seen, she was looking through an ancient book. Reimu sees the potential dangers in this, and proceeds to the chamber. There, they are greeted by Remilia Scarlet. She says she was waiting for Reimu to show up. Remilia has built the castle, spread the scarlet mist, and lured Reimu and her party for her plan... \n \nTo excavate buried treasure. Remilia read in a book about a treasure that lies underneath a red castle, so she instructed her servants to build a red castle. She spread the scarlet mist because the treasure must be excavated during daytime, as she cannot work during daytime normally. She lured Reimu to the castle so they can help excavate the treasure. Before she follows up her plan, Reimu interrupts. She says the treasure is only a legend based on the \"Red Mountain Castle\" on Mt. Akagi, and the treasure doesn\u0027t exist. It\u0027s only a legend from the outside world. With the incident now solved, Reimu proceeds to leave. Just then, Remilia changes her plan, saying she lured them to the castle so they can fight under the scarlet moon. Reimu and Remilia battle. Remilia is defeated, but she orders Meiling, Patchouli, and Sakuya to attack them. After they are defeated once again, and Remilia once again fights Reimu. After much struggle, Reimu and her party is victorious. With the incident solved, they all have a party back in the Hakurei Shrine. \n \nA few days passed, and Reimu heads to the castle once again to ask why the castle hasn\u0027t been taken down. Along the way, she is attacked by Rumia. Reimu proceeds to the castle and asks questions, but Meiling refuse to answer. Sakuya says now isn\u0027t the time, as they are running across a problem. When she meets Patchouli, she states that it isn\u0027t Remilia\u0027s fault, but \"her.\" Reimu enters the basement of the castle, and she meets Flandre Scarlet, who is angry that once again she is ignored and everyone had a party without her. Flandre attacks Reimu out of spite. After a hard battle, Flandre is defeated, but the fighting has calmed her down."

The story follows Frank Carter, a disgruntled married man who discovers a new arcade in his neighborhood that appears to have just popped up. Frank is then pulled into a dark world where one wrong step can lead to being trapped in there forever. The story unfolds in dark ways, revealing the twisted nature of DARCADE. However, with help from the human like A.I. in the game, he just might be able to find a way out of this hell. \n \nGameplay: \n \nThe game features a run, gun, and jump style, meant to take you back to the PS2 era of platform gaming with a fresh new look provided with the help of Unreal Engine 4. The challenges in each original level will have a different way of applying the mechanics provided. For the time being, gamepad is supported in-game, but not in the UI/menus, something which is intended to be fixed for the final release. The gameplay forces players to be careful about every step they take, as death traps are everywhere in the world of DARCADE. There are traps ranging from evil monsters to endless pits and beyond. Each level requires a different character be saved from a cage. These characters will provide you with different abilities which will help you navigate your way through DARCADE. A quest tab is available throughout the game to help you keep track of what to do next. Within the game, there are 8 unique missions that take place in 8 different worlds, so a new experience is guaranteed for each level. The Kickstarter button in the main menu will be changed for an options menu in the full release. \n \nDemo: \n \nThe demo included is the first level of the game, which is really meant to just introduce the world and some of the different mechanics that you\u0027ll be using throughout the game. \n \nDEMO LINK: \n \nhttps://mega.nz/#!l6xyQTIQ!1rO_fZsxskPVB4_44l8VUEPd7x0PgdH3iPhizR0qWEg \n \nPlease note that the demo version is a 64-Bit build. A 32-Bit version may be made available upon enough requests. \n \nMore about the game: \n \nThe game features 8 levels that are increasingly complex and challenging, culminating in a dramatic final level. The game uses Unreal Engine 4, which produces a fantastic final product and an overall smooth experience. The levels are all made to completion with 3D-Models, soundtracks, and challenges that can be found in beautiful environments that vary widely between level to level. The landscape and mechanics are constantly changing in D-ARCADE in an effort to be as eye-pleasing as possible.  \n \nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1118218286/darcade-pc-game-demo-available?ref\u003dnav_search"

A solar eclipse occurs while they\u0027re there. During the eclipse, Whiskey is taken away by an unseen creature. Andy then rushes to his treehouse, where he keeps his inventions, and jumps inside a spaceship to find Whiskey. He takes off and finds himself in the Darklands, which is a portion of the Heart of Darkness. Inhabited by creatures of the night and ruled over by an evil sorcerer that\u0027s known as the Master of Darkness, the Darklands are extremely dangerous. Andy must find it in himself in order to rescue Whiskey and find a way home. \n \nAndy collides his spaceship into a winged shadow creature and crashes in a canyon on the outskirts of the Darklands. Here, his gun is eaten by a giant monster. Andy manages to escape into the swamps, only to run into more danger while unarmed. Meanwhile, the Master of Darkness is abusing his servant when a winged shadow arrives with a sack that has Whiskey in it. Angered by the mistake (the shadow was supposed to capture Andy), the Master of Darkness kills the shadow and takes his anger out on his servant by throwing him at a spiked wall. However, the monster that swallowed Andy\u0027s gun appears, accidentally saving the servant, and explains Andy being in the Darklands. The Master of Darkness then orders his minions to search the Darklands for him. \n \nDeep in the swamp, Andy saves a winged creature that\u0027s named Amigo that starts to carry him to his home island, but is dazed by a fireball that was thrown from a winged shadow and drops Andy into a lake. At the bottom of the lake, Andy comes across a magic rock that grants him the power to manipulate plants and destroy enemies. After resurfacing, Andy is rescued once again by Amigo, who takes Andy back to his home and introduces him to his people. Andy wins their approval by creating an apple tree for them. The Amigos then agree to hide Andy in their village, but the shadows attack and destroy the village when night falls. However, Andy manages to slip away. After reuniting with the Amigos, Andy witnesses an Amigo fall to the evil ground, and becomes a winged shadow within contact. Andy convinces the Amigos to obtain the magic rock\u0027s power and wage war on the Master of Darkness. \n \nWith their newfound powers the Amigos help Andy slip into the Master of Darkness\u0027s lair. While in there, Andy is captured and thrown into a cell with Whiskey, but manages to escape and free Whiskey. Meanwhile, the Master of Darkness\u0027s minions have found the magic rock and bring it to the Master, who destroys it, thus draining Andy and the Amigos\u0027 powers. Unarmed once again, Andy can only run from the shadows. While fleeing, he accidentally falls into a hole and lands on top of the giant monster, who promptly swallows Andy whole. However, he is able to escape by obtaining his gun from the monster\u0027s stomach and blasting him in half from within. He then encounters the servant and forces him to help defeat the Master of Darkness and find Whiskey. The servant tells Andy that the only way to defeat the Master of Darkness is to drop the completed magic rock into the dark portal. Andy then searches for the fragments of the rock in order to reform it. He manages to obtain all but one piece, which is laying on the bridge near the portal. While Andy is fighting his way to the bridge, the servant betrays Andy by kicking Whiskey into the portal. \n \nAfter fighting countless shadows and dodging several fire blasts that are thrown by the Master of Darkness, Andy makes it to the bridge and obtains the final piece. The Amigos then tie up the servant and lower the rock onto the bridge, crushing the servant in the process. Ignoring the Master of Darkness\u0027s claim that everyone will be killed if he does so, Andy connects the final piece of rock, which then falls into the portal, which begins destroying the castle and the platform that the Master of Darkness floats on. He then falls into the portal, but manages to take Andy with him. \n \nThey find themselves in the main area of the Heart of Darkness, where they battle. Andy wins the fight and then hears the sound of a door opening, only to see red eyes approaching. He prepares to strike, but lights come on from Andy\u0027s mother, revealing that the eyes are Whiskey, and they are in Andy\u0027s tree house...the whole thing was in Andy\u0027s imagination. Andy\u0027s mother calls them to dinner. After being kissed goodnight by his mother, Andy taunts Whiskey\u0027s fear of the dark a bit and then turns the nightlight off, revealing that he has conquered his fear of the dark thanks to his make-believe journey. The scene then shows the Amigos finding the wreckage of Andy\u0027s ship, with the servant also there tied up, being harassed, revealing that Andy\u0027s adventure was not imaginary."

The Bubble Gun manages to be released from the portal and lands at the feet of Rascal, who picks it up, vowing to save his dad. \n \nRascal chases the two through time, from the medieval Castle Hackalott, to the Aztec Temple at Chichimeca, to the lost city of Atlantis, to the Jolly Raider pirate ship and Dodgy City in the old West, travelling to each location\u0027s past and present forms and collecting the pieces of a Time Clock from both before fighting Chronon in each area\u0027s future. Afterwards Rascal travels to the Corridors of Time, Chronon\u0027s lair within the space-time continuum where, after defeating its guardians brought from each of the other time periods, he successfully defeats Chronon and rescues his dad. After escaping using another time portal, Rascal and his dad safely return home, leaving the portal to shatter and trap Chronon in interdimensional time forever."

However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \"main path\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \"Elsewhere\". Despite the game\u0027s considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. \n \nAs Kid Chameleon moves through the game\u0027s levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points."
