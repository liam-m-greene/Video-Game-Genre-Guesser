There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24-second violations. This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, if a player makes three baskets in a row, he becomes \"on fire\" and has unlimited turbo and increased shooting precision. The \"on fire\" mode continues until the other team scores, or until the player who is \"on fire\" scores 4 additional consecutive baskets while \"on fire.\"\nThe game is filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, pressing A five times and right five times on any Genesis controller would activate \"Super Clean Floors\". This feature would cause characters to fall if they ran too fast or changed direction too quickly. And players can enter special codes to unlock hidden players, ranging from US President Bill Clinton to Hugo the Charlotte Hornets mascot. On the arcade machine, there is also a hidden \u0027tank\u0027 game that allows the player to run around a 3D wireframe field. In order to access this mode, however, the player must be able to toggle the on/off switch located behind the machine.

At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking / defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design.

This allowed the player a more realistic feel, and made Bases Loaded into one of the most popular baseball games for early NES. \nThe league was made of fictitious teams, as it was difficult to achieve a license from the MBA, and included 12 American cities with unique players on each team. One unique feature that the game included was that each team had one batter who would charge the mound when provoked by the pitcher."

The fictitious teams remained from the original game, with the addition of a number of new players. A new addition to the game was the concept of biorhythm, which encouraged players to keep track of the biorhythm of each player on their team, in order to achieve optimal performance during the season. As well, the starting lineup and batting order was user controlled, and the view of the batter was changed from the first game."
