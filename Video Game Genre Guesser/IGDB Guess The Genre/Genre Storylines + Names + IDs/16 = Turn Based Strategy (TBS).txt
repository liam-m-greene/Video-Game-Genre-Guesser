Your settlement progress has been spectacular, and although you\u0027re nearing retirement, you\u0027ve managed to expand the colony from its meager initial size of 100 adult citizens in a valley, to over 1,000 residents of all ages spread over several outposts during your tenure. \n \nUnfortunately, the \u0027Sustenance and Nutrient Generator\u0027 you were given seems to be malfunctioning, as the animals being created have recently exhibited violent behaviour and are now chasing down your people as they flee to the founding settlement. You need to set up defenses to slow the tide of violent animals, while you begin a search for a lasting solution."

The jungle sounds behind you fade, and in their place comes a wet thudding, as of rotten rigging against a mouldy mast. The sound multiplies, and with it, the groan of a thousand breathless voices, joined in something part-shanty, part-dirge. Dread prows pierce the gloom ahead, and the ghastly truth is laid bare: upon the ghoul-winds come the swollen hulks and decaying vessels of the Vampire Coast! Run now – run hard and fast. For it is all you can do. \n \nIt was the undying lord Luthor Harkon that laid claim to a stretch of Lustria’s east coast. Ever since, it has been a domain where the dead stir, leading expeditions into the jungle interior or setting sail across the Great Ocean to commit wanton acts of piracy. But the insane Arch-Commodore Harkon is not the only unliving admiral who takes to the seas with pistol-armed crews of zombies, vampiric depth guard, syreens and mournguls… there are other pirate lords who command dreadfleets of their own, packed to the gunwales with crews press-ganged into eternal service. \n \nThese tyrants ply the seas seeking plunder of blood and gold. However, now that the vortex of Ulthuan weakens, the captains search for more than mere treasure… for the Star-Metal Harpoon lies in the deeps, a weapon powerful enough to bring the greatest Merwyrm of them all to heel"

Even after hundreds of years of slavery, the Mudlanders are determined to overthrow their masters. Tarnum appoints the Gnoll, Brellick, as a captain and the Witch, Adamina, as his advisor. He also trains Droglo, a human boy who was raised by Mudlanders. The Mudlanders defeat opposition from Lord Onsten and Baron Paglon before Mad King Gryphonheart of Erathia takes the rebellion seriously.\r\n\r\nMad King Gryphonheart sends his son Niven to put down the rebellion in Earl Rambert\u0027s territory, though he secretly thinks his son will fail. Tarnum captures Prince Niven and shows him what slavery has done to the Mudlanders. Niven eventually sides with Tarnum, and he is released from his prison. The Mudlanders force Rambert to retreat to another castle and leave many of his prisoners behind. When Rambert threatens to kill the remaining prisoners, including Adamina, if Tarnum does not return Niven, Tarnum sends Brellick, Droglo, and Niven to make the exchange after harming Niven so that he looks like a true prisoner. However, Rambert ambushes their army and kills Brellick. Droglo then kills Rambert, and the Mudlanders soon win the battle. To prepare for the final battles against Mad King Gryphonheart, Tarnum sends Droglo to request the aid of the Barbarians of Krewlod (the Wastelands).\r\n\r\nAdamina and the other wisewomen name the new Mudlander nation \"Tatalia,\" a word which means \"community\" in the forgotten Mudlander language now only known to witches. In Erathia, the nobles displeased with Mad King Gryphonheart name Niven as their new king. King Niven mounts an army to join the army of Tatalia in the fight against the old king\u0027s remaining supporters. Droglo finally discovers Tarnum\u0027s identity as the Immortal Hero, but accepts that he has changed. Tarnum and Mad King Gryphonheart meet in battle and deal each other seemingly mortal blows. However, Tarnum is immortal, and he slips away before his body can be buried. Droglo becomes the new leader of Tatalia."

    "storyline": "In The Sword of Frost, a direct sequel to Clash of the Dragons, Gelu, wielder of Armageddon\u0027s Blade, sets out to destroy the Sword of Frost. Tarnum, having heard of an ancient prophecy that the meeting of the two swords will bring about the end of the world, struggles to stop Gelu. With the recent chaos after the death of Queen Mutare of Nighon, Tarnum is able to take control over the Dungeon creatures of Nighon who are the only ones who wish to fight Gelu, becoming an Overlord. However, ruling these brutal creatures brings out the darkness in Tarnum.\n\nThe Sword of Frost is located in the northern lands of the Vori elves. Gelu is half-Vori, so the elves fight against Tarnum. In addition, Tarnum\u0027s own troops are prone to internal conflicts. After being shot with a poisoned arrow by a medusa, Tarnum appoints his saviours,the beholders, Neez, Zarm, and Kilkik as his bodyguards and advisors. They take revenge against the medusas, but Zarm dies in the process.\n\nKija, the third wife of King Kilgor, also chases Gelu for the Sword of Frost. She plans to steal it from him and give it to her husband so that her son will be named heir to Krewlod. Tarnum cannot convince Kija or Gelu to give up their search, so he decides to gain an edge by adding the Azure Dragons to his army.\n\nGelu understood that the Sword of Frost could only be destroyed by Armageddon\u0027s Blade. However, he didn\u0027t know that this could only be done under very delicate circumstances. Tarnum knew that if Gelu were to try to destroy it using only brute force, the cataclysm would occur.\n\nIn order to learn more about the Sword of Frost, Tarnum captures Gelu\u0027s friend and captain, the dwarf Ufretin. While he does so, he replaces his remaining beholder bodyguard Kilkik with the minotaur Trongar and the medusa Zallisa. Tarnum convinces Ufretin to understand him before allowing the dwarf to return to Gelu. Ufretin buys Tarnum enough time to capture Kija and annihilate her army. However, Gelu soon continues his march toward the city of Volee (where the sword is held).\n\nWhen Tarnum finally beats Gelu to Volee, he discovers that the Sword of Frost has already been taken by Kija, who had escaped from her dungeon prison a few weeks earlier. In the chronicle\u0027s ending scene, Tarnum prays to the Ancestors, \"Please don\u0027t let my compassion destroy the world!\" As Heroes IV begins, it is revealed that shortly after the events of The Sword of Frost, Gelu fights Kilgor who now wields the Sword of Frost. Kilgor was about to wage war on all of Antagarich, but he was stopped by Gelu and the Forest Guard. When the two blades meet in battle, they cause an explosion that destroys the world of Enroth. Many of the planet\u0027s residents, however, escape through thousands of mysterious portals leading to a new world, Axeoth. This event becomes known as the Reckoning, which leads into Heroes of Might and Magic IV."
