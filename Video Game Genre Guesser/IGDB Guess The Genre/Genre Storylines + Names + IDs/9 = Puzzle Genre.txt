This will place a domino on the current path. The player can continue to keep placing dominoes by holding down one of the aforementioned buttons. \n \nWhen a full lap is completed around the stage and returned to where the first domino was laid, the character will bump into the domino. The dominoes will begin an effect of inertia, and the character will stand still while the dominoes are falling. \n \nWhile active, the character\u0027s stamina will decrease. This is signified by the character\u0027s body gradually darkening. If the character\u0027s stamina is depleted, the character will transform into an ordinary domino, and the game will end. This is prevented by encountering on special Recovery Tiles that can recover the character\u0027s stamina, but can only be used once for each tile. \n \nThe player clears a stage by activation of the required number of trick tiles for each stage.

    "name": "Pythagorea",
    "storyline": "Pythagoras of Samos was a Greek philosopher and mathematician. One of the most famous geometric facts bears his name: the Pythagorean Theorem. It states that in a right-angled triangle the area of the square on the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides. \n \nWhile playing Pythagorea you often meet right angles and rely on the Pythagorean Theorem to compare lengths of segments and distances between points. That is why the game is named after Pythagoras."

    "storyline": "Each level features a 3D “planet” made up of little blocks that’s floating in space. There are three stars to collect, plus a portal that allows you to proceed to the next level. You move Qub by tapping anywhere on the part of the screen that’s the direction you want him to go. To be most precise, you can tap the arrows in the four corners of your screen. If there’s a ledge that’s short enough to jump up to, he will automatically jump to it. Walk Qub onto thin air and he’ll fall and lose a star, but return just as cheerful as ever. Nothing, and I mean nothing, wipes the smile off this little guy’s face. \n \nBesides controlling Qub, you rotate the entire planet by swiping the screen in any direction. This is how you get Qub to different sides of the planet. Fans of Monument Valley may feel at home with this control scheme. But be careful! Unlike Monument Valley, you can fall off the planet, and there are consequences for it. And it can be a bit frustrating sometimes when you accidentally walk off the edge. The “impossible architecture” concept of Monument Valley also does not apply here. Just because it seems like two blocks connect from one angle, doesn’t mean they do. You need to make sure from every angle that you’re lined up with a block before you rely on it to catch you."
