The player\u0027s challenge as Pac-Man is to retrieve the Artifact\u0027s four pieces from the now ghost-infested time periods and return them to the present.

Although the Time Machine sometimes malfunctions, sending Pac-Man to an unexpected place and time, he is eventually able to obtain in each era one of the four pieces of the Artifact. Afterwards, the Time Machine malfunctions again before Pac-Man can return to the present, instead bringing him to a fifth time-period: the future. Professor Pac-Man claims that an alternate power source is needed to bring him home from the future. In this fifth time-period, Pac-Man finally comes to the Reactor Core and is able to harness its energy to be finally transported, with the Artifact reassembled, to the second after the Mollusc broke the Artifact in the game\u0027s introduction scene. Aiming the now-repaired Artifact at the Mollusc, Pac-Man fires a beam of light at his foe, vaporizing the Mollusc and grinning triumphantly."

The research team\u0027s results were sent back to Earth on the \"Galaxy space capsule\", which malfunctioned, crashed into the ocean, and broke into many pieces. The capsule included several data canisters, each of which contains small snippets of the scientists\u0027 story, which is revealed to the player as the game progresses and data canisters are found. The capsule also contained some toxic chemicals, which have begun to leak out and threaten the health of the world\u0027s sea life. A recovery mission, codenamed Operation Neptune, is sent to recover the pieces of the capsule.\nThe game is divided into five zones: Dragon Reef, Fossil Trench, Limestone Ridge, Sea Forest, and Hammerhead. Each zone contains three \"levels\", called sectors (although the hammerhead zone also has a \"final\" sector, where there are no maths problems, but one hit from a sea creature will send the player back to the start). At the end of each sector, the submarine approaches an undersea supply station. There are two completely unique sets of levels, Voyager and Expert, each with a different story that is recovered along the way.\nThe player pilots the submarine, named the Neptune. Throughout the game, elementary school-level mathematics problems are posed, in the form of scientific situations that might concern a submarine pilot in real life. (For example, the sub\u0027s ballast may need adjusting, and this becomes an arithmetic problem.) In each sector the player will face three randomly placed math problems, as well as one problem to open that sector\u0027s data canister, and another to open the combination lock on the supply station.The box cover illustration rendered by Marc Ericksen envisions the Neptune submarine recovery vehicle hovering above the basin of Fossil Trench recovering glowing toxic data capsules."

The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same. \n \nAt round 33, the final stage, the player will take on the game\u0027s boss, \"DOH\", a head resembling moai. Once a player reaches round 33, he must defeat DOH with his remaining extra lives because there are no continues on the final round."
